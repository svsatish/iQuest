# Quickstart

Run this from your existing project root:

```bash
npx iquest init
```

The interactive wizard asks 4 questions — then everything is set up automatically.

---

## Step 1: Choose your agent

| Agent | SDK | Best for |
|-------|-----|----------|
| **Claude Code** | `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` | Anthropic models only |
| **OpenCode** | `@opencode-ai/sdk` | Any provider: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and more |

Both agents connect to the same Playwright MCP server over HTTP and expose the same interface. You can swap between them by changing one import.

---

## Step 2: Choose your model

**Claude Code** models:

| Model | Speed | Best for |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | Fast | Default, most tests |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Medium | Complex flows |
| `claude-opus-4-7` | Slow | Most demanding tasks |

**OpenCode** models use `provider/model` format:

| Model | Provider |
|-------|----------|
| `gitlab/duo-chat-haiku-4-5` | GitLab Duo (default) |
| `github-copilot/gpt-5.4` | GitHub Copilot |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` | Anthropic |
| `openai/gpt-4o` | OpenAI |
| `google/gemini-2.0-flash` | Google |

Or enter any custom model name your OpenCode installation supports.

---

## Step 3: Choose your framework

**Playwright-BDD** — Uses Gherkin `.feature` files with the Playwright test runner. Recommended.

**Cucumber.js** — Standard Cucumber with Playwright browser automation.

---

## Step 4: Point to your feature files

Enter the relative path from your project root to your `.feature` files. For example:

- `features/` — default
- `tests/features/`
- `src/test/features/`

The harness will be configured to point at them automatically, wherever they live.

---

## What gets created

```
your-project/
└── .iquest/               ← agent harness lives here
    ├── .env.example       ← copy to .env and fill in your values
    ├── .env.schema        ← committed schema: variable types, defaults, secret redaction
    ├── playwright.config.ts  (or cucumber.js)
    ├── features/          ← example feature files (edit or replace these)
    │   ├── todomvc.feature        ← 2 scenarios
    │   └── getting-started.feature ← 1 scenario
    └── steps/
        ├── fixtures.ts    ← Playwright-BDD only
        └── steps.ts       ← single AI step definition
```

Feature files live in `.iquest/features/` by default. To move them, update the path in `playwright.config.ts` (or `cucumber.js`) — see [Writing Feature Files](#writing-feature-files).

## Authentication

::: tip
**No API key needed for local development.** Just log in once with the CLI and you're done.
:::

### Claude Code (local)

```bash
claude login
```
One-time login. No `.env` needed for local runs.

### OpenCode (local)

```bash
opencode auth login
```
One-time login — works with GitLab Duo, GitHub Copilot, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and more. No `.env` needed for local runs.

### API Key (Claude Code)

```bash
cp .iquest/.env.example .iquest/.env
# then add:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
Use this for CI or if you prefer an explicit key.

### API Key (OpenCode)

```bash
cp .iquest/.env.example .iquest/.env
# then add whichever provider key you need:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
Use this for CI or if you prefer an explicit key.

## Environment Variables

The scaffolded project uses [varlock](https://varlock.dev) for environment variable management. Variables are defined in `.env.schema` (committed to git) and values go in `.env` (gitignored). Secrets are automatically redacted from logs.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BASE_URL` | — | App URL — sets Playwright `baseURL` and injected into every agent prompt |
| `APP_USERNAME` | — | Username — injected into agent prompt for login steps |
| `APP_PASSWORD` | — | Password — injected into prompt; always redacted from logs |
| `API_TOKEN` | — | API Bearer token — injected into agent prompt for API steps; always redacted |
| `OPENQA_VERBOSE` | `true` | Set `false` to suppress step-by-step agent logs |
| `HEADLESS` | `true` | Set `false` to watch the browser |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Anthropic API key — CI only (use `claude login` locally) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | OpenAI API key — CI only via OpenCode |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | — | Google API key — CI only via OpenCode |

All variables are optional. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and uncomment what you need.

### Adding your own variables

Declare them in `.env.schema`, add values to `.env`:

```env
# .env.schema
# @sensitive=false
ENVIRONMENT = staging

STAGING_USER =
# @sensitive
STAGING_PASSWORD =
```

---

## Customizing Your Setup

`iquest init` is a starting point — everything in `.iquest/` is yours to edit.

**Playwright config** — `.iquest/playwright.config.ts` is a standard [Playwright config file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration). Update timeouts, add projects, enable retries, change reporters — anything the Playwright docs describe will work here.

**Step definitions** — `.iquest/steps/steps.ts` is a regular [Playwright-BDD](https://playwright-bdd.dev) step file (or [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) for the Cucumber framework). Add non-AI steps, Before/After hooks, or custom fixtures alongside the AI step.

---

## Writing Feature Files

Two example feature files are scaffolded into `.iquest/features/` — edit or replace them with your own tests.

Use `*` (asterisk) for natural, AI-friendly steps:

```gherkin
Feature: TodoMVC

  Scenario: Add a todo item
    * I navigate to "https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/"
    * I add a new todo item "Buy groceries"
    * I should see "Buy groceries" in the todo list

  Scenario: Filter completed todos
    * I navigate to "https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/"
    * I add three todo items: "Task 1", "Task 2", and "Task 3"
    * I mark the first todo as completed
    * I click the Active filter
    * I should see 2 active todos
```

Standard `Given`/`When`/`Then` also works — both are identical under the hood.

### Tips for good steps

- Be specific about URLs: `I navigate to "https://..."` not `I go to the site`
- Quote the exact text you expect: `I should see "Buy groceries"`
- Describe intent, not mechanics: `I add a new todo item "..."` not `I click the input and type "..."`

### Hybrid UI + API Scenarios

A single scenario can seamlessly mix browser and API steps. The agent automatically selects the right toolset:

```gherkin
Feature: User registration flow

  Scenario: Register via API, then verify in UI
    * Call POST "/api/users" with body { "email": "test@example.com", "password": "secret123" }
    * Verify the response status is 201
    * Verify the JSON body has "id" equal to a non-empty string
    * Navigate to "/login"
    * Fill "email" with "test@example.com"
    * Fill "password" with "secret123"
    * Click "Submit"
    * Should see "Welcome, test@example.com"
```

**How the agent decides:**
- Words like "navigate", "click", "fill", "type", "should see", "verify element" → **browser tools**
- Words like "call GET/POST/PUT/DELETE", "api", "endpoint", "request", "response", "status", "header", "json", "body" → **API tools**

### Moving feature files elsewhere

Update the path in `.iquest/playwright.config.ts` (or `cucumber.js`):

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts — point to a directory outside .iquest/
const testDir = defineBddConfig({
  featuresRoot: '../features',
  features: '../features/**/*.feature',
  steps: 'steps/*.ts',
});
```

---

## Run your tests

```bash
cd .iquest
npm run test:headed   # visible browser
npm run test          # headless
npm run test:report   # open the HTML report
```

---

## Changing Model or Provider

Your model is set in one line inside `.iquest/steps/steps.ts` (Playwright-BDD) or `.iquest/steps/steps.js` (Cucumber.js). Open that file and change the provider call — that's it.

### Change the Claude Code model

```typescript
import { runAgent, claudeCode } from 'iquest';

// Fast (default)
await runAgent(claudeCode('claude-haiku-4-5'), action, page);

// More capable
await runAgent(claudeCode('claude-sonnet-4-6'), action, page);
await runAgent(claudeCode('claude-opus-4-7'), action, page);
```

### Switch to OpenCode — GitLab Duo or GitHub Copilot

```typescript
import { runAgent, openCode } from 'iquest';  // swap the import

// GitLab Duo (if you use gitlab.com — login with opencode auth login)
await runAgent(openCode('gitlab/duo-chat-haiku-4-5'), action, page);

// GitHub Copilot (if you use GitHub — login with opencode auth login)
await runAgent(openCode('github-copilot/gpt-5.4'), action, page);
```

### Switch to OpenCode — Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google

```typescript
import { runAgent, openCode } from 'iquest';

await runAgent(openCode('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6'), action, page);
await runAgent(openCode('openai/gpt-4o'), action, page);
await runAgent(openCode('google/gemini-2.0-flash'), action, page);
```

::: warning
Switching between `claudeCode` and `openCode` requires changing the import **and** the provider call. Everything else — feature files, step syntax, test runner commands — stays the same.
