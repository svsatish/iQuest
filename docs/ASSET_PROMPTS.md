## Brand Identity

**OpenQA** is an open-source initiative building **world-class AI agents and tools for QA and test automation**. Our first product is the **OpenQA Test Automation Agent** — natural language browser testing that eliminates selectors, reduces flakiness, and lets QA engineers write tests in plain English.

**Brand Personality:**
- **Bold & Innovative** — Y Combinator startup energy
- **Developer-First** — Clean, technical, approachable
- **Open Source Spirit** — Community-driven, transparent
- **Premium Quality** — Best-in-industry, not another hobby project

**Tagline:** *No selectors. No flake. Just plain English.*

## Logo Prompts

### Primary Logo (Square)
```
Modern minimal tech logo for "OpenQA" - an open source AI test automation company.

Design direction: Clean geometric mark that combines concepts of "open" (like an open door, bracket, or aperture) with "QA/testing" (checkmark, verification, automation loop).

Style: Flat vector, single color works on any background. Think Linear, Vercel, Supabase level polish.

Colors: Vibrant violet (#8b5cf6) or bright purple (#a855f7) - NOT dark navy. Should feel energetic and modern, not corporate/heavy.

Avoid: Generic robot icons, magnifying glasses, bugs, gears. No gradients or 3D effects. NO dark navy or near-black purples.
```

### Logo Variations Needed
| Asset | Size | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Primary Mark | 512×512 | Square, icon only |
| Full Logo | 800×200 | Mark + "OpenQA" wordmark |
| Favicon | 32×32, 16×16 | Simplified mark |
| GitHub Avatar | 400×400 | Square, visible at small sizes |

## Frontend Design Guidelines

```markdown
name: frontend-design
description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality.
```

### Design Philosophy

Before coding, commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:
- **Purpose**: Developer tool landing page for AI test automation
- **Tone**: Premium tech startup — refined minimalism with strategic maximalist moments
- **Differentiation**: The one thing to remember: "Tests written in plain English, actually work"

### Critical Rules

1. **Typography**: Use distinctive fonts (Space Grotesk, Geist, Satoshi). NEVER use Inter alone, Arial, or system defaults.

2. **Color**: Dark theme primary. Dominant backgrounds with sharp accent colors. No purple-gradient-on-white clichés.

3. **Motion**: One well-orchestrated page load animation > scattered micro-interactions. Staggered reveals, scroll-triggered effects.

4. **Layout**: Asymmetric compositions. Generous negative space. Grid-breaking hero elements.

5. **Backgrounds**: Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns. NEVER plain solid colors.

6. **Details**: Glowing borders, subtle shadows, grain overlays. Custom cursor optional.

### What to AVOID

❌ Generic AI aesthetics (purple gradients, robot illustrations)
❌ Stock photos of people "using computers"
❌ Overused font stacks (Inter/Roboto/system-ui)
❌ Cookie-cutter SaaS layouts
❌ "AI slop" — anything that looks auto-generated

### Inspiration

- Linear.app (motion, polish)
- Vercel.com (dark theme, developer aesthetic)
- Anthropic.com (premium AI company feel)
- Supabase.com (open source energy)
- Raycast.com (product-focused design)
